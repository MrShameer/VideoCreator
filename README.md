# AI Brainrot TikTok Video Generator

This script generates "**Brainrot**" TikTok videos by combining a random background, an AI-generated story (using [Ollama's Gemma2](https://ollama.com/library/gemma2) LLM), and Text to speech voices (via [play.ht's Text-to-Speech API](https://play.ht/text-to-speech-api/python/)). The final output is a complete video ready for upload.

## Features
- **Story Generation**: Uses the Gemma2 LLM to generate creative and quirky stories.
- **Text-to-Speech**: Converts the story into character voices using play.ht's API.
- **Random Backgrounds**: Automatically selects a random video or image as the background.
- **Configurable Characters**: Modify character names and system prompts in a JSON file.
- **Simple Execution**: Run the script with a single command.

## Voice Selection

You can get a **list of available voices** from play.ht's documentation [here](https://docs.play.ht/reference/python-sdk). Update the `"id"` field for each character in the `config.json` file to match one of the supported voice IDs.
